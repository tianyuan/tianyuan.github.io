Quick guide to edit, build and deploy this website built with Quarto. 

### Preview Site

Preview the site locally. 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto preview <site-name> 
# e.g., quarto preview ytian-web
```

### Edit Nav and Sidebars

[Website navigation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) is defined in the [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/blob/main/_quarto.yml) file in the root folder.

Edit the `_quarto.yml` YAML file to add or remove sidebar attributes.

### Freeze Posts with Code

Render and [freeze](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html#freeze) a post with `freeze:true` in the `_metadata.yml` file under the `posts` folder. 

You can explicitly re-render it when needed. 

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
# render single document (always executes code)
quarto render document.qmd

# render project subdirectory (always executes code)
quarto render articles
```
