My research has involved a wide variety of data-rich modelling projects including in modelling COVID-19, Tuberculosis (TB), stroke, emergency department wait times, the interface of community service provision and acute care, hospital design, and health services projections. Many analyses have made central use of data science tools. I also led several Big-Data efforts in classifying tweets for COVID-19 and Influenza prediction.\nResearch Interests: infectious disease modelling, health service and research, patient flow, dynamic modelling, machine learning for text analysis"
